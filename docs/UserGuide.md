7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command. Be sure to check the [Understanding Command Syntax](#understanding-command-syntax) section to understand how to properly enter commands in CaféConnect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Understanding Command Syntax

Let's start with a simple example to understand how commands work in CaféConnect:

> `help` *- This is a basic command that opens the help window.*

Breaking this down:
- A **command** is an instruction you give to CaféConnect to perform a specific action.
- Some commands, like `help`, are simple and don't need any additional information.
- Other commands require **parameters** (additional details) to work properly.

Let's look at a more complex example:
> `customeradd cid/C001 n/John Doe`

In this example:
- `customeradd` is the command.
- `cid/C001` and `n/John Doe` are parameters.
- Each parameter has a **prefix** (like `cid/`, `n/`) that tells CaféConnect what kind of information follows.

### Basic Command Rules

* Commands are **case-insensitive** - `HELP`, `help`, and `Help` all work the same way.

* Parameters shown in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders that you need to replace with actual values:
  - Example: `cid/CUSTOMER_ID n/NAME` have placeholders `CUSTOMER_ID` and `NAME`.
  > `customeradd cid/C0001 n/John Doe` - *"C0001" replaces CUSTOMER_ID, "John Doe" replaces NAME*

* Optional parameters are shown in square brackets `[]`:
  - Example: `[t/TAG]` means you can add a tag or leave it out.
  > `customeradd cid/C0001 n/John Doe t/regular` - *Here, "regular" is an optional tag that was added*

* Some parameters can be repeated (shown with `…`):
  - Example: `[t/TAG]…` means you can add multiple tags or none at all.
  > `customeradd cid/C0001 n/John Doe t/regular t/vip` - *Here, both "regular" and "vip" are optional tags that were added*

### Parameter Order Rules

* For most commands, you can enter parameters in any order:
  - `n/John Doe p/98765432` works the same as `p/98765432 n/John Doe`

* Quick commands (like `quickcustomeradd`) need parameters in a specific order:
  - Example: `quickcustomeradd C001:John Doe:98765432` must be in ID:Name:Phone order
  > `quickcustomeradd C001:John Doe:98765432` - *Here, "C001" is the CUSTOMER_ID, "John Doe" is the NAME, and "98765432" is the PHONE*

### Command Alias

To make typing easier, CaféConnect provides alias for common commands:

* Customer Management:
  - `ca` instead of `customeradd`
  - `cd` instead of `customerdelete`
  - `cf` instead of `customerfind`

* Staff Management:
  - `sa` instead of `staffadd`
  - `sd` instead of `staffdelete`
  - `sf` instead of `stafffind`

* Drink Management:
  - `da` instead of `drinkadd`
  - `dd` instead of `drinkdelete`

* Purchase Operations:
  - `p` instead of `purchase`
  - `qp` instead of `quickpurchase`

### Finding a staff: `stafffind` or `sf`

Finds and lists all staffs in the staff list whose names contain any of the specified keywords. The search is case-insensitive, meaning it will match names regardless of letter casing.

Format: `stafffind [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [sid/STAFF_ID] [role/ROLE] [shift/SHIFT_TIMING] [hours/HOURS_WORKED] [rating/PERFORMANCE_RATING] [t/TAG]...`
Format: `stafffind all/true` (to list all staff)

* The search will return all staffs who matches the specified search criteria.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided or `all/true`.
* The keyword search for `[n/NAME]` do not need to match the full name exactly; partial matches within the name are included. For example, searching `n/john doe` will match `John Doe`, `John Tan`, or `Jane Doe`.
* The keywords search for `[n/NAME]` is case-insensitive. For example, searching for `alice` will match `Alice`, `ALICE`, or `aLiCe`.
* The keywords search for `[p/PHONE]` `[e/EMAIL]` `[a/ADDRESS]` `[sid/STAFF_ID]` `[role/ROLE]` `[shift/SHIFT_TIMING]` `[hours/HOURS_WORKED]` `[rating/PERFORMANCE_RATING]` `[t/TAG]` MUST match the field exactly and is case-sensitive. For example , searching `role/Barist` will return nothing if role should be `role/Barista`; searching `role/chef` will return nothing if drink should be `role/Chef`
* Use `stafffind all/true` or `sf all/true` to display the complete list of all staff in CaféConnect.

Examples:
* `stafffind n/Alice` or `sf n/Alice` finds and lists all staffs whose names contain `Alice`.
* `stafffind n/John Doe` or `sf n/John Doe` finds and lists all staffs whose names contain either `John` or `Doe`.

## FAQ

Get your questions or doubts about CaféConnect's functionality and details answered here. If you have further questions, you can contact us through our email <font color="#dd0000">cafeconnect@gmail.com</font>.

#### Q1: Where is the data for the application stored?

Ans: CaféConnect's data is saved automatically as JSON files `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` for customer and staff data, `[JAR file location]/data/drinkcatalog.json` for drink catalog data, and `[JAR file location]/preferences.json` for user preferences. You can make a backup of these files if you wish to.

#### Q2: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

Ans: Install CaféConnect on the other computer. Then copy and replace the following files from your current installation to the new one:
- `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` (for customer and staff data)
- `[JAR file location]/data/drinkcatalog.json` (for drink catalog data)
- `[JAR file location]/preferences.json` (for user preferences)

#### Q3: Can I edit the data files directly?

Ans: You are strongly encouraged to **not** edit the JSON data files directly. You can use the commands as mentioned above to manage any data. Should the changes made to the data files cause the format to be invalid, CaféConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file. It is highly recommended to make a copy of the data files before editing them.

Users should only edit the data files only if they are confident in updating them correctly.

#### Q4: What is considered valid, when editing the JSON data files directly?

Ans: Data entries are valid as long as it follows the data entry rules enforced by the application, and are achievable using the available commands.

Examples:
Having `C001` is an invalid `customerId` field for a customer, if it's already assigned to another customer, as there is no sequence of commands that will lead to duplicate customer IDs.

Having `regular` is a valid `tag` field for a customer, as the user can `customeradd` a customer and add the tag via `t/regular`.

#### Q5: How are reward points calculated?

Ans: Currently, customers earn 10 points for every $1 spent on purchases. Points are automatically updated when you record a purchase using the `purchase` command.

#### Q6: Will my customer's reward points expire?

Ans: CaféConnect doesn't have a built-in expiration for reward points. Points accumulate indefinitely until used.

#### Q7: What happens if I try to record a purchase for a drink that's not in the catalog?

Ans: The system will display an error message indicating that the drink was not found in the catalog.

#### Q8: After I add a new customer or staff, where will they appear in the list?

Ans: New entries will not be inserted in any specific order. They are inserted to the bottom of the list.

#### Q9: Will adding/deleting customers or staff be reflected immediately in the UI?

Ans: Yes, all changes to customer or staff data are immediately reflected in the UI. The information panels will update to show the current state of your data.

#### Q10: Are there quicker means to add customers and staff quickly?

Ans: Yes, you can use the quick version of these commands:
- For customers: `qca C0102:Charlie:97285712`
- For staff: `qsa S0102:Ali:98291029`

In fact, the corresponding quick version works for purchases made:
- For purchase: `qp 1:Latte`
- For purchase (redeem): `qp 1:Latte:r`

Quick commands streamline operations by minimizing keystrokes and simplifying syntax, making them ideal for fast-paced café environments.

#### Q11: Can I import existing customer data from CSV or Excel files?

Ans: Currently, CaféConnect doesn't support direct importing from spreadsheet files. You'll need to enter customer and staff data manually.

#### Q12: How do I track staff working hours?

Ans: Use the `staffedit` command to edit worked hours to a staff member's record.

#### Q13: Can I edit a customer's visit count manually?

Ans: Yes, the visit count can be edited via the `customeredit`.

#### Q14: What do I do when there is a blank screen after my `stafffind` or `customerfind` returns no results

Ans: Use the `staffind all/true` command to show all existing staff again.

## Troubleshooting

If you are facing problems while setting up or using CaféConnect, we want to help you. This section covers some of the common problems and ways to solve them.

### CaféConnect application setup failed

Check that you have the `cafeconnect.jar` in the correct folder and copied the correct file path into the terminal. Check that you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer. Follow the correct set of instructions based on your operating system.

### Getting errors when using the commands

- Check that you have typed the correct command syntax as explained in the [Understanding Command Syntax](#understanding-command-syntax) section.
- Verify you have included all necessary parameters.
- Ensure you have used valid inputs within character limits:
  - NAME must not exceed 50 characters
  - CUSTOMER_ID/STAFF_ID must not exceed 10 characters
  - ADDRESS must not exceed 100 characters
  - PHONE must be between 3 and 20 characters
  - FAVOURITE_ITEM must not exceed 30 characters
  - ROLE and SHIFT_TIMING must not exceed 50 characters

### "Unknown command" error appears

- Check for typos in the command name (e.g., `customeradd` vs `customradd`)
- Verify you're using the correct command syntax as specified in the [Understanding Command Syntax](#understanding-command-syntax) section
- Remember commands are case-insensitive, but parameter prefixes must be exact (e.g., `n/` for name)

### Interface not showing all information

- Try resizing the application window to view more content
- Use the appropriate tab (Staff, Customers, or Drinks Menu) to view specific information
- If information appears cut off, try scrolling within panels to view additional content

### Missing customer or staff data after adding

- Verify you've entered all required fields
- Check if you're in the correct tab to view the newly added entry
- Try using the find command with `all/true` parameter to refresh the list view

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard alias `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
