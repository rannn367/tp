## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format in CafeConnect:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `customeradd cid/CUSTOMER_ID`, `CUSTOMER_ID` is a parameter which can be used as `customeradd cid/C001`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/regular` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/vip`, `t/vip t/regular` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Shortcut commands (`c` and `s`) require parameters in the exact order shown.<br>
  e.g. `c C0102:Charlie:97285712` must have Customer ID, then Name, then Phone in that order.

* Customer IDs must start with 'C' followed by digits (e.g., C1001), and Staff IDs must start with 'S' followed by digits (e.g., S1001).

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take parameters (such as `help`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

- `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` (for customer and staff data)
- `[JAR file location]/data/drinkcatalog.json` (for drink catalog data)
- `[JAR file location]/preferences.json` (for user preferences)

#### Q3: Can I edit the data files directly?

Ans: You are strongly encouraged to **not** edit the JSON data files directly. You can use the commands as mentioned above to manage any data. Should the changes made to the data files cause the format to be invalid, CafeConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file. It is highly recommended to make a copy of the data files before editing them.

Users should only edit the data files only if they are confident in updating them correctly.

#### Q4: What is considered valid, when editing the JSON data files directly?

Ans: Data entries are valid, if they are achievable through a sequence of commands.

Examples:
Having `C001` is an invalid `customerId` field for a customer, if it's already assigned to another customer, as there is no sequence of commands that will lead to duplicate customer IDs.

Having `regular` is a valid `tag` field for a customer, as the user can `/customeradd` a customer and add the tag via `t/regular`.

#### Q5: How are reward points calculated?

Ans: Currently, customers earn 10 points for every $1 spent on purchases. Points are automatically updated when you record a purchase using the `purchase` command.

#### Q6: Will my customer's reward points expire?

Ans: CafeConnect doesn't have a built-in expiration for reward points. Points accumulate indefinitely until used.

#### Q7: What happens if I try to record a purchase for a drink that's not in the catalog?

Ans: The system will display an error message indicating that the drink was not found in the catalog.

#### Q8: After I add a new customer or staff, where will they appear in the list?

Ans: New entries will not be inserted in any specific order. They are inserted to the bottom of the list.

#### Q9: Will adding/deleting customers or staff be reflected immediately in the UI?

Ans: Yes, all changes to customer or staff data are immediately reflected in the UI. The information panels will update to show the current state of your data.

#### Q10: Can I use shortcuts to add customers and staff quickly?

Ans: Yes, you can use the shortcut commands:
- For customers: `c C0102:Charlie:97285712`
- For staff: `s S0102:Ali:98291029`

These shortcuts allow you to quickly add basic information, which you can later edit to add more details if needed.

#### Q11: Can I import existing customer data from CSV or Excel files?

Ans: Currently, CafeConnect doesn't support direct importing from spreadsheet files. You'll need to enter customer and staff data manually.

#### Q12: How do I track staff working hours?

Ans: Use the `hoursadd ind/INDEX h/HOURS` command to add worked hours to a staff member's record. The hours will be added to their current total.

#### Q13: Can I edit a customer's visit count directly?

Ans: No, the visit count is automatically incremented each time you record a purchase for that customer.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
