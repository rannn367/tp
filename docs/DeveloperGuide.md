## **Design**
### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `customerdelete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the `DeleteCustomerCommand`.

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.
### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The **UI** consists of several key components:

1. **WelcomeScreen**: The initial screen users see when launching the application. It provides:
   - A welcoming interface with the CafeConnect logo
   - Buttons to access staff/customer management and drink menu
   - A fade-in animation for a polished appearance

2. **MainWindow**: The main application window that appears after the welcome screen. It contains:
   - A tabbed interface for switching between staff, customer, and drink management
   - Command input area for executing commands
   - Result display area for showing command outcomes
   - Status bar for displaying application state

3. **List Panels**: Each tab contains specialized panels:
   - `StaffListPanel`: Displays staff members with their basic information
   - `CustomerListPanel`: Shows customers with their basic details
   - `DrinkListPanel`: Presents the drink catalog items

4. **Detail Panels**: Each list panel has a corresponding detail panel:
   - `StaffDetailPanel`: Shows comprehensive staff information
   - `CustomerDetailPanel`: Displays detailed customer information
   - `DrinkDetailPanel`: Shows complete drink information

5. **Support Components**:
   - `CommandBox`: For entering commands
   - `ResultDisplay`: Shows command execution results
   - `StatusBarFooter`: Displays application status
   - `HelpWindow`: Provides access to help documentation

All these components inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The **UI** component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The **UI** component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands
* Depends on classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Customer`, `Staff`, and `Drink` objects residing in the `Model`
* Contains a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between staff management, customer records, and the drink catalog
* Features visual elements like charts to display customer metrics and sales data when requested
* Uses custom fonts (Gotham font family) for a professional appearance
* Implements robust error handling with user-friendly error dialogs

The `HelpWindow` component is shown when you execute a help command. It contains a link to the detailed user and developer guide on this CafeConnect documentation website.
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("customerdelete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `customerdelete 1` Command" />

> **_NOTE:_** The lifeline for `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCustomerCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a staff).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The model component represents the data domain of CafeConnect and provides APIs for accessing and modifying this data.

<puml src="diagrams/ModelOverviewClassDiagram.puml" width="850" height="500" />

**Model Overview**

The `Model` component,

* Stores different types of data essential for café management:
  * Core data entities: `Person`, `Staff`, `Customer`, and `Drink` objects
  * User preferences via the `UserPrefs` class
* Exposes _unmodifiable_ `ObservableList<T>` objects for UI components to bind to
* Provides validation methods for checking if entities already exist in the system
* Implements methods to add, remove, and modify data entities
* Does not depend on any of the other components (UI, Logic, or Storage)

The diagram above shows the main structure of the `Model` component. For clarity, we'll examine each entity model in more detail below.

#### Person Model
<puml src="diagrams/PersonModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />

The `Person` model:

* Serves as the base class for both `Staff` and `Customer` entities
* Contains common attributes for all persons: `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, and `Tag`s
* Enforces validation for all fields through specialized field classes
* Is stored in a `UniquePersonList` that ensures no two persons have the same identity

#### Staff Model
<puml src="diagrams/StaffModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />

The `Staff` model:

* Extends the `Person` class, inheriting all person attributes
* Adds staff-specific fields: `StaffId`, `Role`, `ShiftTiming`, `HoursWorked`, and `PerformanceRating`
* Uses `StaffId` as the primary identifier for staff members
   * `StaffId` is used in `Staff::isSamePerson` to determine staff uniqueness
* Implements staff-specific behavior for operations like performance tracking
* Is stored in a `UniquePersonList` that enforces uniqueness based on `Staff::isSamePerson`
   * Possible since `Staff` extends `Person` class

#### Customer Model
<puml src="diagrams/CustomerModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />

The `Customer` model:

* Extends the `Person` class, inheriting all person attributes
* Adds customer-specific fields: `CustomerId`, `RewardPoints`, `VisitCount`, `FavouriteItem`, and `TotalSpent`
* Uses `CustomerId` as the primary identifier for customers
   * `CustomerId` is used in `Customer::isSamePerson` to determine customer uniqueness
* Implements customer-specific behavior for operations like reward point tracking and visit counting
* Is stored in a `UniquePersonList` that enforces uniqueness based on `Customer::isSamePerson`
   * Possible since `Customer` extends `Person` class

#### Drink Model
<puml src="diagrams/DrinkModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />

The `Drink` model:

* Defines drink items available in the café menu
* Contains essential drink attributes: `DrinkName`, `Price`, and `Category`
* Includes optional attributes like `description` and `stock` that don't affect identity
* Uses `DrinkName` as the primary identifier for drinks
* Is stored in a `UniqueDrinkList` that enforces uniqueness based on drink names
* Implements business logic for reward points calculation in the `Price` class:
  * Earning points: 10 points per dollar spent
  * Redeeming points: 100 points equals to $1 value
* Is managed through the `DrinkCatalog` class that implements `ReadOnlyDrinkCatalog`

Each entity in the Model component follows value semantics (meaning two entities with identical fields are considered equal) and is immutable for core fields to prevent unexpected side effects.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="850" />

The `Storage` component,
* Can save and load data in JSON format across multiple data files:
  * `addressbook.json` - Stores all staff and customer data
  * `drinkcatalog.json` - Stores the drink menu data
  * `preferences.json` - Stores user preferences like window size and position
* Inherits from multiple interfaces: `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefsStorage`, and `DrinkCatalogStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Is implemented by `StorageManager`, which coordinates all persistence operations by delegating to specialized storage classes.
* Uses Jackson library for JSON serialization and deserialization.
* Creates JSON-adapted versions of model objects through adapter classes:
  * `JsonAdaptedPerson` serves as the base adapter for person entities
  * `JsonAdaptedStaff` and `JsonAdaptedCustomer` extend the person adapter with specialized fields
  * `JsonAdaptedDrink` handles drink menu items
* Depends on classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

The sequence diagram below illustrates the storage operations that occur when executing a command that modifies data (such as `customerdelete 1`):

<puml src="diagrams/StorageSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800" />

When the application starts:
1. `MainApp` initializes `StorageManager` with the appropriate storage components for address book, drink catalog, and user preferences.
2. `StorageManager` attempts to load data from each storage file.
3. If any file is missing or corrupted, the application creates a new empty data structure for that component.

When a command modifies data:
1. After the model is updated, `LogicManager` calls `storage.saveAddressBook(model.getAddressBook())` (or the equivalent method for other data types).
2. `StorageManager` delegates to the appropriate storage component:
  * `JsonAddressBookStorage` for staff and customer data
  * `JsonDrinkCatalogStorage` for drink menu data
  * `JsonUserPrefsStorage` for user preferences
3. The storage component converts model objects to their JSON-adapted versions and writes the resulting JSON to the appropriate file.

> **_NOTE:_** If a data file is corrupted, the application will simply create a new empty data structure. Users must manage backups of their data files manually.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Staff Management System

#### Adding a staff to the addressbook

<puml src="diagrams/AddStaffSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddStaffSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `AddStaffCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`AddStaffCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the prefixes `sid/`, `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `role/`, `shift/`, `hours/`, `rating/`, `r/` and `t/`.
It ensures that:
- The **ID prefix** `sid/` must start with a "S" followed by digits (e.g., S1001, s1001).
- The **name prefix** `n/` must contain only alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it cannot be blank.
- The **phone prefix** `p/` must contain only digits and be at least 3 digits long.
- The **email prefix** `e/` must contain a valid email address.
- The **address prefix** `a/` must contain a non-blank address.
- The **role prefix** `role/` must contain a non-empty role.
- The **shift prefix** `shift/` must contain a non-empty shift.
- The **hours prefix** `hours/` must contain a non-negative integer.
- The **rating prefix** `rating/` must contain only digits that are between 0 and 5.0 (inclusive) and of 1 decimal place.
- The **remark prefix** `r/`, if provided, must contain one non-empty remark.
- The **tag prefix** `t/`, if provided, must contain one or more non-empty tags.

If any of these constraints are violated, `AddStaffCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddStaffCommand` based on the user input.

---

`AddStaffCommand` stores the staff to be added, represented as a `Staff` instance.

Upon execution, `AddStaffCommand` first checks the model for duplicate staff. If no existing staff member with a matching (case-insensitive) staff id is found, it adds the new staff member to the address book.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect identifies a staff member as a duplicate if their `SID` matches (case-insensitive) with an existing staff member in the address book. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

#### Deleting a staff from the address book

The delete staff feature allows users to remove staff from the address book by specifying the staff's index in the displayed list.

The implementation follows the command pattern where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `DeleteStaffCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStaffSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteStaffSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteStaffCommandParser` to parse user input string.

`DeleteStaffCommandParser` extracts the index from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.

If the index is invalid, `DeleteStaffCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteStaffCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `DeleteStaffCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered staff list. If the index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.

If the index is valid, `DeleteStaffCommand`:
1. Retrieves the staff to be deleted from the filtered staff list.
2. Calls `model.deleteStaff(staffToDelete)` to remove the staff from the address book.
3. Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect only allows deleting staff by index. Once a staff member is deleted, they cannot be recovered unless added again manually.

#### Editing a staff's details

The edit staff feature allows users to modify the details of an existing staff member by specifying the staff's index in the displayed list and the new details.

The implementation follows the command pattern, where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `EditStaffCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/EditStaffSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditStaffSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `EditStaffCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`EditStaffCommandParser` extracts the index and provided fields from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.
- At least one field is provided for editing.

If the input is invalid, `EditStaffCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `EditStaffCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `EditStaffCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered staff list. If the index is out of bounds, a CommandException is thrown.

If the index is valid, `EditStaffCommand`:
1. Retrieves the staff member to be modified from the list.
2. Extracts the updated details from `EditStaffDescriptor`.
3. Constructs a new `Staff` instance using `StaffBuilder`.
4. Checks for duplicate staff entries in the system and throws a `CommandException` if a duplicate is found.
5. Updates the model with the modified staff information.
6. Returns a `CommandResult` confirming the successful edit.

<br></br>

### Customer Management System

#### Adding a customer to the addressbook

<puml src="diagrams/AddCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddCustomerSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `AddCustomerCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`AddCustomerCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the prefixes `cid/`, `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `rp/`, `vc/`, `fi/`, `ts/`, `r/` and `t/`.
It ensures that:
- The **ID prefix** `cid/` must start with a "C" followed by digits (e.g., `C1001`).
- The **name prefix** `n/` must contain only alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it cannot be blank.
- The **phone prefix** `p/` must contain only digits and be at least 3 digits long.
- The **email prefix** `e/` must contain a valid email address.
- The **address prefix** `a/` must contain a non-blank address.
- The **reward points prefix** `rp/` must contain only digits.
- The **visit count prefix** `vc/` must contain only digits.
- The **favourite item prefix** `fi/` can take any value, but it cannot be blank.
- The **total spent prefix** `ts/` must contain only digits representing the amount in dollars.
- The **remark prefix** `r/`, if provided, must contain one non-empty remark.
- The **tag prefix** `t/`, if provided, must contain one or more non-empty tags.

If any of these constraints are violated, `AddCustomerCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddCustomerCommand` based on the user input.

---

`AddCustomerCommand` stores the customer to be added, represented as a `Customer` instance.

Upon execution, `AddCustomerCommand` first checks the model for duplicate customers. If no existing customer with a matching (case-insensitive) customer id is found, it adds the new customer to the customer list.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect identifies a customer as a duplicate if their `CID` matches (case-insensitive) with an existing customer in the list. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

#### Deleting a customer from the address book

The delete customer feature allows users to remove customers from the address book by specifying the customer's index in the displayed list.

The implementation follows the command pattern where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` to parse user input string.

`DeleteCustomerCommandParser` extracts the index from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.

If the index is invalid, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteCustomerCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `DeleteCustomerCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered customer list. If the index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.

If the index is valid, `DeleteCustomerCommand`:
1. Retrieves the customer to be deleted from the filtered customer list.
2. Calls `model.deleteCustomer(customerToDelete)` to remove the customer from the address book.
3. Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect only allows deleting customers by index. Once a customer is deleted, they cannot be recovered unless added again manually.

#### Editing a Customer's Details

The edit customer feature allows users to modify the details of an existing customer by specifying the customer's index in the displayed list and the new details.

The implementation follows the command pattern, where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `EditCustomerCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/EditCustomerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditCustomerSequenceDiagram" />  

`AddressBookParser` creates `EditCustomerCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`EditCustomerCommandParser` extracts the index and provided fields from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.
- At least one field is provided for editing.

If the input is invalid, `EditCustomerCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `EditCustomerCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `EditCustomerCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered customer list. If the index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.

If the index is valid, `EditCustomerCommand`:
1. Retrieves the customer to be modified from the list.
2. Extracts the updated details from `EditCustomerDescriptor`.
3. Constructs a new `Customer` instance using `CustomerBuilder`.
4. Checks for duplicate customer entries in the system and throws a `CommandException` if a duplicate is found.
5. Updates the model with the modified customer information.
6. Returns a `CommandResult` confirming the successful edit.

<br></br>

### Drink Management System

#### Adding a drink to the catalog

<puml src="diagrams/AddDrinkSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddDrinkSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `AddDrinkCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`AddDrinkCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the prefixes `n/`, `p/`and `c/`.

It ensures that:
- The **name prefix** `n/` must contain a valid drink name.
- The **price prefix** `p/` must contain a valid positive decimal value.
- The **category prefix** `c/` must contain a non-empty category name.

If any of these constraints are violated, `AddDrinkCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddDrinkCommand` based on the user input.

---

`AddDrinkCommand` stores the drink to be added, represented as a `Drink` instance.

Upon execution, `AddDrinkCommand` first checks the model for duplicate drinks. If no existing drink with a matching (case-insensitive) name is found, it adds the new drink to the catalog.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect identifies a drink as a duplicate if its `NAME` matches (case-insensitive) with an existing drink in the catalog. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

#### Deleting a drink from the catalog

The delete drink feature allows users to remove drinks from the catalog by specifying the drink's index in the displayed list.

The implementation follows the command pattern where `AddressBookParser` identifies the command type and delegates to `DeleteDrinkCommandParser` to create the appropriate command object.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteDrinkSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteDrinkSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteDrinkCommandParser` to parse user input string.

`DeleteDrinkCommandParser` extracts the index from the command arguments and ensures:
- The **Index** is a valid positive integer.

If the index is invalid, `DeleteDrinkCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteDrinkCommand` based on the user input.

---

Upon execution, `DeleteDrinkCommand` first checks if the index is within the bounds of the filtered drink list. If the index is out of bounds, a `CommandException` is thrown.

If the index is valid, `DeleteDrinkCommand`:
1. Retrieves the drink to be deleted from the filtered drink list.
2. Calls `model.deleteDrink(drinkToDelete)` to remove the drink from the catalog.
3. Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect only allows deleting drinks by index. Once a drink is deleted, it cannot be recovered unless added again manually.

<br></br>

### Customer Purchase and Points System

#### Recording a customer purchase

<puml src="diagrams/PurchaseSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="PurchaseSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates an instance of `PurchaseCommandParser` to parse the user input string.

`PurchaseCommandParser` first extracts values corresponding to the index, the prefix `n/`, and the prefix `redeem/`.

It ensures that:
- The **customer index** must be a valid positive integer.
- The **drink name prefix** `n/` must refer to an existing drink in the catalog.
- The **redemption prefix** `redeem/`, if provided, must be either "true" or "false".

If any of these constraints are violated, `PurchaseCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `PurchaseCommand` based on the user input.

---

`PurchaseCommand` stores the customer index, drink name, and redemption status.

Upon execution, `PurchaseCommand` first retrieves the customer at the specified index and searches for the drink in the catalog by name. It then processes the purchase based on the redemption status:

1. For regular purchases:
   - Calculates reward points (10 points per dollar)
   - Updates the customer's total spent
   - Updates the customer's reward points
   - Increments the visit count
2. For point redemptions:
   - Verifies the customer has sufficient points
   - Calculates points needed (100 points per dollar)
   - Deducts points from the customer
   - Keeps total spent unchanged
   - Increments the visit count

> **_NOTE:_** The points calculation follows a fixed rate of 10 points per dollar spent. Redemption follows a rate of 100 points equivalent to $1 in drink value.

<br></br>

### Quick Command Shortcuts

The implementation of shortcut commands provides an efficient way for café owners to add new entries and record purchases with minimal typing.

#### Types of Shortcut Commands

CaféConnect implements two distinct types of shortcut commands:

1. **Entity Creation Shortcuts** - For quickly adding new customers and staff:
   * `qc CID:NAME:PHONE` - Quick add a customer
   * `qs SID:NAME:PHONE` - Quick add a staff member

2. **Operation Shortcut** - For quickly recording purchases:
   * `qp INDEX:DRINK_NAME[:r]` - Quick record a purchase (with optional redemption)

#### Entity Creation Shortcuts
<puml src="diagrams/StaffShortcutCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800" />
<puml src="diagrams/CustomerShortcutCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800" />

These commands allow users to rapidly add new customer and staff entries during busy periods when full detailed commands might be impractical. The implementation works as follows:

1. `AddressBookParser` detects shortcut commands and routes them to the appropriate handler:
   * `qc` routes to the customer shortcut handler `CustomerQuickCommandParser`
   * `qs` routes to the staff shortcut handler `StaffQuickCommandParser`

2. The shortcut parsers process the input using these steps:
   * Split the input string at the colon separators
   * Validate that exactly three components are present (ID, name, and phone)
   * Create a new entity with the provided values and default values for other fields
   * Return the appropriate command object (e.g., `AddCustomerCommand` or `AddStaffCommand`)

3. The command is then executed like any standard command:
   * The model is updated with the new entity
   * The updated model is saved to persistent storage
   * A success message is displayed to the user

> **_NOTE:_** Entity creation shortcuts only accept three parameters (ID, name, and phone). Other fields are set to default values and can be updated later using the edit commands.

#### Purchase Shortcut
<puml src="diagrams/PurchaseShortcutCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800" />

The purchase shortcut enables café staff to quickly record customer purchases with an optional redemption flag. The implementation differs from entity creation shortcuts:

1. `AddressBookParser` detects the `qp` command and routes it to the `PurchaseCommandParser`.

2. The purchase parser processes the input using these steps:
   * Validates the input against the pattern `^[0-9]+:.+(:r)?$`
   * Splits the input at the colon separators
   * Extracts the customer index (first part) and drink name (second part)
   * Checks for the presence of an optional third part "r" that indicates a redemption purchase
   * Returns a `PurchaseCommand` with the extracted parameters

3. The purchase command execution:
   * Retrieves the customer at the specified index
   * Verifies the drink exists in the drink catalog
   * Records the purchase, updating customer metrics (visit count, reward points, total spent)
   * For redemption purchases (with `:r`), deducts reward points instead of increasing total spent
   * Displays a success message with the updated customer information

> **_NOTE:_** The purchase shortcut uses a different parameter format than entity creation shortcuts. It takes a customer index (not ID), requires an existing drink name, and has an optional redemption flag.

This implementation adheres to the Command pattern used throughout the application while providing a streamlined interface for common operations. All shortcuts follow a colon-separated format for consistency, but with different parameter requirements based on their function.

### Data Storage and Persistence

CaféConnect uses JSON-based storage to persist data across application restarts. The storage implementation separates different entity types into distinct files:

- `addressbook.json`: Stores staff and customer data
- `drinkcatalog.json`: Stores drink catalog data
- `preferences.json`: Stores user preferences like window size and position

<puml src="diagrams/StorageSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="StorageSequenceDiagram" />

When saving data, the following sequence occurs:
1. A command that modifies data is executed
2. The model is updated with the changes
3. The storage manager is notified to save the changes
4. The appropriate storage component serializes the data to JSON
5. The JSON data is written to the file system

On application startup, the reverse process occurs:
1. The storage manager attempts to read data from the JSON files
2. If successful, the data is deserialized into model objects
3. If any file is missing or corrupted, a new empty data structure is created

> **_NOTE:_** CafeConnect implements data backup and recovery mechanisms. If a data file is corrupted, the application attempts to back it up before creating a new empty data structure.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
The team consists of 5 members.
Given below are enhancements planned for future versions. <br>

1. **CLI functionality to display customer/staff on right panel** 
   - Current behaviour: Currently whenever a user wants to view a customer, they have to manually click the GUI and display the customer on the right panel. There is no CLI way to do this which makes the app limited in its CLI optimisation.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to add a `display` command or similar feature that takes in the index of the person on the current list and displays it on the right panel.
   <br></br>
   - Justification: This is a key usability feature that should have been CLI optimised. Adding this command will improve workflow efficiency for users who prefer keyboard-based interaction over mouse clicks.
   <br></br>

2. **Update right panel when new staff filtering commands are executed** 
   - Current behaviour: When a user clicks on a staff to reveal additional information and then enters a command to filter staff (e.g., `sf n/Alice`), the original staff being viewed still remains on the right panel even though the list of staff displayed has changed.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to update the right panel display when filtering commands are executed, either by clearing the display or by showing the first result of the new filtered list.
   <br></br>
   - Justification: The current behavior creates a confusing user experience where the information displayed on the right doesn't match the context of the current filtered list. This enhancement will ensure that the UI remains consistent and intuitive during filtering operations.
   <br></br>

3. **Relax name constraints to support more diverse naming conventions**
   - Current behaviour: According to the user guide, names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and names must not be blank and must not be longer than 50 characters. This is too restrictive to handle the diversity of names in the real world.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to expand the allowed characters in names to include common special characters found in names worldwide, such as hyphens, apostrophes, and certain accented characters.
   <br></br>
   - Justification: The current constraints do not accommodate many legitimate names used globally. For example, names like "O'Connor", "López-García", or names containing non-English characters are currently rejected by the system. Relaxing these constraints will make our application more inclusive and internationally friendly.
   <br></br>

4. **Implement validation for unique phone numbers and email addresses** 
   - Current behaviour: Currently, the system allows different customers or staff members to have the same phone number and email address as long as they have different IDs. This can lead to confusion and potential data entry errors, as phone numbers and email addresses are typically unique identifiers in real-world scenarios.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to implement validation that prevents duplicate phone numbers and email addresses across all customers and staff members. The system will check for existing records with the same contact information before allowing a new entry or update.
   <br></br>
   - Justification: This enhancement will improve data integrity and prevent scenarios where a user might mistakenly add the same customer or staff member twice with different IDs. It also reflects real-world constraints, as generally no two people share exactly the same phone number or email address for professional purposes.
   <br></br>

5. **Improve purchase logic to support multiple items in a single transaction** 
   - Current behaviour: Currently, each purchase can only contain 1 item, and each purchase increases the visit count of a customer by 1. This means that if a customer buys multiple drinks in a single visit, they would need to be recorded as separate transactions, artificially inflating the visit count.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to implement a cart or multi-item purchase system that allows recording multiple items in a single transaction. This would increment the visit count only once while still accurately tracking all items purchased and their total cost.
   <br></br>
   - Justification: This enhancement will better reflect real-world cafe operations, where customers often purchase multiple drinks or items in a single visit. It will provide more accurate visit metrics and customer purchasing behavior, improving the reliability of customer data for business decision-making.
   <br></br>

6. **Make email addresses selectable and copyable** 
   - Current behaviour: Email addresses in the customer and staff details cannot be selected or copied. To use an email address in another application (e.g., to send an email to a customer), users have to manually type the entire email address. Clicking or dragging the mouse over the email address has no effect.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to modify the UI to make email addresses selectable and copyable text elements. This will allow users to easily copy email addresses with a simple click or keyboard shortcut.
   <br></br>
   - Justification: This enhancement will significantly improve workflow efficiency, particularly for café owners who need to contact customers or staff via email. It eliminates the need for manual retyping, reduces the risk of typographical errors, and streamlines communication processes.
   <br></br>

7. **Improve staff role and shift timing validation** 
   - Current behaviour: Staff role and shift timing can currently accept any value, and they're only restricted by a 50-character limit. This means users can enter random strings like "-50" as a role or shift timing, which works but doesn't make semantic sense in a café context.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to implement a more structured approach to staff roles and shift timing by:
     * Defining a set of standard roles (e.g., "Barista", "Manager", "Cashier") through an enumeration
     * Implementing a proper shift timing format using Java's datetime, with clear start and end times
     * Adding validation to ensure meaningful values are entered
     * Potentially offering preset options like "Morning Shift (5am-1pm)" or "Evening Shift (2pm-10pm)"
   <br></br>
   - Justification: Proper validation of staff roles and shift timing will improve data consistency and make the application more intuitive for café owners. It prevents nonsensical data entry and will help with staff scheduling, reporting, and management functions.
   <br></br>

8. **Enhance drink menu management and validation** 
   - Current behaviour: Currently, the application has several limitations with the drinks menu:
     * Drink categories can be any arbitrary string (even nonsensical values like "pants")
     * The system allows adding customers with favorite items that don't exist in the drinks menu
     * There's no structured way to categorize drinks consistently
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to improve the drink menu system by:
     * Implementing predefined drink categories (e.g., "Coffee", "Tea", "Cold Drinks")
     * Adding validation to ensure favorite items for customers exist in the current drinks menu
     * Creating a reference system between customer favorite items and actual menu items
     * Providing autocompletion or dropdown selection when assigning favorite items to customers
   <br></br>
   - Justification: These enhancements will improve data integrity and user experience. By ensuring that favorite items refer to actual menu items, the system will provide more meaningful customer preferences data. Standardized categories will also help with menu organization and reporting on drink sales by category.
